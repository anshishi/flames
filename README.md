# 🔥 FLAMES - Love Compatibility Game

**FLAMES** is a nostalgic love compatibility game that predicts the relationship between two people using their names. This digital version is built entirely in **Python**, perfect for CLI-based fun and beginner-level projects.

## 💡 What is FLAMES?

FLAMES stands for:

- **F** – Friends  
- **L** – Love  
- **A** – Affection  
- **M** – Marriage  
- **E** – Enemies  
- **S** – Siblings

The game eliminates common letters in two names, counts the remaining characters, and cycles through the letters in **FLAMES** to predict a relationship type.

---

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Input two names.
2. Common letters (including duplicates) are canceled out.
3. The number of remaining characters is used to cycle through FLAMES.
4. The last letter remaining is your result.
